ABSTRACT
The goal of this program is to help the user study for the general GRE with preloaded math, vocabulary, and verbal reasoning questions created in a .txt document. This program is not a full computer-based general GRE: it is instead a tool to do quizzes with the user having the ability to customize their document of quiz questions. Therefore, this program can be used for any multiple choice practice, including CSC212 quiz questions. The program supports text box answers and multiple choice answers ranging from 1 to 9 (A-I), as well as the option for selecting multiple answers in one question.


When a user adds questions to the text document, the user can open it in any writable program, such as Notepad, and follow this structure: 
SOURCE  NUMBER_OF_ANSWERS CORRECT_ANSWER  INSTRUCTIONS  QUESTION  CHOICE_A  CHOICE_B ...  CHOICE_I
where each element is seperated by the tab button. If an element is not applicable, user should follow the format of previous questions and fill it in appropriately.


PROJECT FILES

The software you need on your computer:
This software was produced on Java SE Runtime Environment 8, but is compatible with Java SE Runtime Environment 7 as well. The user needs to be able to access their computer’s console in order to run the .java file


HOW TO RUN
Download a .zip folder of all the project files from https://github.com/jcg0105/QuizBuilder/ and extract the files. The question documents' file paths do not need to be edited as long as the documents are in the same folder as the GREpractice_JGSG.java file. In your java terminal, run the “GREpractice_JGSG.java” file by typing "java GREpractice_JGSG.java".

BUGS
This program does not display images. Therefore, the math questions are a biased representation of the math GRE questions since only text questions are able to be displayed rather than questions involving geometry figures or other visuals. The creators may incorporate visual questions after this Fall 2020 semester concludes.
